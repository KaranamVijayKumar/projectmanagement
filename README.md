### Risk Mitigation Strategies

We used the following risk mitigation strategies:

| Resource Risk | Technical Risk | Market Risk | Cost Risk | Schedule Risk |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| New employees must be recruited in different areas to act as substitutes | Ensure proper knowledge sharing from current employees to the new employees | Making customers familiar with the product | Meet the costs of new licenses of softwares or systems if required | Authority of Project Manager should be increased |
| Allot costs for new employees | Increase the frequency of project monitoring | Gain knowledge regarding the market | Use Work Breakdown Structure and CPM | Choose the most experienced person in the project as the manager of the project |
| Assign knowledge sharing sessions for new employees |  Check the product and its quality before it is produced in the market | Know how to innovate the product based on the current and new technologies in the market | Increase frequency of project monitoring | Use WBS and CPM |
| Give importance to team support and avoid stand alone project sturcture | Use WBS and CPM | Produce the product into the market in appropriate time | Allot some extra cost for any unknown requirements | Increase frequency of project monitoring |

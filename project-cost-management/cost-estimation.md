# Cost Estimation 

There are three project cost management processes:
## 1. Estimating Costs : 
This involves developing an approximation or estimate of the cost of the resources needed to complete a project. The main outputs of the cost estimating process are activity cost estimates, basis of estimates, and project
document updates.
## 2. Determining the budget :
This involves allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance. The main
outputs of the cost budgeting process are a cost performance baseline, project funding requirements, and project document updates.
## 3. Controlling costs :
This involves controlling changes to the project budget. The main outputs of the cost control process are work performance measurements, budget forecasts, organizational process asset updates, change requests, project management plan updates, and project document updates.

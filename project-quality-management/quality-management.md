## Quality Planning

### Define Project Quality

| What to do                                              | How to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Identify the overall quality objectives for the project |            State the quality objectives in terms of the project objectives and/or organizational objectives. Determine quality objectives for the product with the customer. There may be overall organizational quality objectives or policies that the project can reference. |

| Identify the key project deliverables that will be subject to quality review                                                |                The key deliverables are the results that need to be delivered fit-for-purpose as identified in the project charter. Example project deliverables: Project Charter, The web application, System Design, Building blueprint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Identify the standards that will be used to evaluate the quality of project deliverables                                    |                Identify the relevant deliverable quality standards, or “measures” used to determine a successful outcome for a deliverable. Ideally your organization has identified quality standards to be applied. If not, determine what you will use for your project. Example industry quality standards/ methods: TQM, Six Sigma, Quality Gates, SPC, Zero Defects, quality circles, continuous improvement, ISO 9000 Example quality standards for a project deliverable*:* Project Charter format, Web Interface Standards, Documentation Standards                                                                                                                                                                |
| Identify the completeness and correctness criteria                                                                          |                Completeness and correctness criteria are defined from the customer’s point of view. Work with the customer to define a “complete and correct” deliverable. The deliverables are evaluated against these criteria before they are formally approved. Example criteria for Project Charter: standard template was used for the project charter, project deliverables are clearly defined. Example criteria for a product: 95% defect free, All regulatory requirements are met, All reports and online displays tie out and balance.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Describe the *Quality Control* activities the project will use to ensure quality standards for project deliverables are met |                *“Quality Control makes sure the results of what you have done are what you expected. Quality control is product oriented.”* Quality control activities are associated with the creation of project *deliverables*. Quality control prevents and resolves errors in project deliverables. Quality Control verifies that deliverables are of acceptable quality and they meet the deliverable quality standards and the completeness and correctness criteria established. For each deliverable, describe the quality control activities you will execute. Example quality control activities: Quality control check list, Deliverable review, Structured walkthroughs, Statistical sampling, Testing process |
| Determine how often or when the quality control activity will be performed.                                                 |                Establish the timeframe or recurring frequency for performing the quality control activity. **Examples**:   Deliverable Review at final delivery, Structured Walkthrough at each module completion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     		|
